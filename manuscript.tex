\section{Introduction}

This would be a good place to insert some text that make sense relative
to the paper being written.
Of course, for example purposes, the text is quite meaningless.

\subsection{Background}

This background section is here only to demonstrate \verb|\subsection|
usage.
And following this, the next section level will need to be demonstrated.

\subsubsection{Detail}

Here is a \verb|\subsubsection| that would normally come in pairs of two
according to the requirements of an outline, but for the sake of
demonstration, we are only showing a single \verb|\subsubsection|.

\section{Model}

We should probably include some math.
Here we begin with Eq.~(\ref{e:function}) that demonstrates some math
typesetting.
\begin{equation}
 \label{e:function}
 \int_{0}^{r_{2}} F(r,\varphi) \, dr \, d\varphi =
    \left[ \sigma r_{2}/(2\mu_{0}) \right] \cdot
    \int_{0}^{\infty} \exp(-\rho|z_{j}-z_{i}|) \, \lambda^{-1} 
\end{equation}
Eq.~(\ref{e:function}) is grand.
Some say it is due to Rebek.\cite{rebek:82bk}

\section{Results}

\section{Conclusion}

After much typing, the paper can now conclude.
Four rocks were next to the channel.
This caused a few standing waves during the rip that one could ride on
the way in or jump on the way out.

\section*{Appendix}

An appendix, if needed, should appear before the acknowledgments.
Use the 'starred' version of the \verb|\section| commands to avoid
section numbering.
Let's try a citation to myself~\cite{kulumani2015}.

\section*{Acknowledgments}
